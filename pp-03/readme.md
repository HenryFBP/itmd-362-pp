1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

  Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=12P0u0kQsaitL5OAG7SQcgxCTmz
  
  Your Rationale: 
  > I wanted to choose a palette that was minimalist, bold, and refined. It looks like a high-end tech product, too.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

  Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=53Y1h0kg5E76bWkbdOIjHvynmru
  
  Your Rationale:
  > I chose these colors because they are light pastel colors that all occur in nature, and definitely occur in flowers. It's easy on the eyes and also vibrant and beautiful.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

  Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=3461g0kvWXGc2++nWQF++uw++kX
  
  Your Rationale:
  > Children-themed things are usually very bright, vibrant, and simple. I chose Red, Green, and Blue because it's a very safe choice and made them as bright as possible (within eyeball-confort sanity)

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

  Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=54e0x0k++kIJ9TSOoFgHYeyyP82
  
  Your Rationale:
  > I wanted to have a palette that looked interesting, but also clean and professional. I wanted it to look elegant but also have similar colors. I chose purple as the base color with two dyad colors on the sides.
